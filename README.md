# VBA-challenge-2
This challenge is a VBA exercise analyzing generated stock market data. 
In this challenge I had to:
Create a script that loops through all the stocks for each quarter and outputs the following information:
  The ticker symbol
  Quarterly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.
  The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.
  The total stock volume of the stock

  I also had to :
  Add functionality to your script to return:
    the stock with the "Greatest % increase"
    "Greatest % decrease", 
    "Greatest total volume"

  The last thing in order to consider this complete was to ensure the script ran on all worksheets at once.

  I made sure to include the screenshots this round.

  Thank you
